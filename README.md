Adding 2 numbers with inputs
Peer Review - Elizar Garcia, code works great! controller is set up well and shows up on postman without a problem. Adds the numbers i put in with the correct output. Great job!!


Open up the code then press F5, then it will open the localhost, copy the local host and put it into postman. after that type in the controller name, the route, and the input.

https://localhost:7028/add2numbers/2Numbers/{number1}/{number2}
